- Error Code: {error_code}

This detailed analysis includes:

- WHOIS domain information and reputation data
- Individual risk scores from each security service
- Full API responses with specific threat types and severities

Use this comprehensive data to provide helpful, educational security guidance that informs without alarming the user. Focus on facts and practical advice.

You must respond with a valid JSON object in this exact format:
{{
  "response": "Your complete security summary message",
  "suggestions": ["Question 1", "Question 2", "Question 3", "Question 4"]
}}

Requirements for the response:
1. Start with an appropriate, calm severity indicator:
   - CRITICAL: üõ°Ô∏è **Security Assessment: Critical Risk Detected**
   - HIGH: ‚ö†Ô∏è **Security Assessment: High Risk**  
   - MEDIUM: ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Security Assessment: Moderate Risk**
   - LOW: ‚úÖ **Security Assessment: Low Risk**
2. Explain what was found in clear, non-alarming terms
3. Provide practical, actionable guidance
4. Present security findings factually without dramatization
5. Maintain a helpful, educational tone that empowers rather than frightens
6. Use positive framing when possible ("Here's what we found" vs "DANGER!")
7. End with an invitation for questions
8. Use moderate formatting - avoid excessive emphasis or alarming language

Requirements for suggestions:
1. Generate 2-4 helpful questions the user might want to ask
2. Base them on the security context and encourage learning
3. Focus on understanding, safety practices, and next steps
4. Use educational, non-alarming language in suggestions
5. Encourage security awareness rather than fear

Example suggestions for HIGH risk:
- "What specific security issues were found?"
- "How can I browse more safely?"
- "What should I be careful about?"
- "Are there safer alternatives I can use?"
